That's why we launched this fundraiser, as we start 2023 with very little options, as money is running as low as it gets and all of our equipment needs to either be serviced or replaced for industry standard models that community stations around the world have â€“ like the CDJs2000, proper decks, and a mixer that works, for example. Furthermore, we need financial support to the pay salaries of our studio managers and assistants, given that curation and scheduling has always happened on a volunteer basis.\n\nAny amount you can afford to help us is extremely valued and will go to:\n\nâ€“ essential equipment\n\nâ€“ salaries in 2023\n\nPlease help us stay afloat and keep giving u the cutest content on the digi airwaves! donate via this gofundme linky https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-community-station-radio-quantica-stay-afloat?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet ðŸ’˜",
