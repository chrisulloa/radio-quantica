# Radio Quantica: Next.js React App

This is the front end code for the R치dio Qu칙ntica website written in Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS. The service is deployed on Vercel.

This app reaches out the R치dio Qu칙ntica Azuracast API and an Apollo GraphQL API to form data during build time and run time. The pages for the app are statically generated using Markdown files in the shows folder.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server `npm install` then `npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
