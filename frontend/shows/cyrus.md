Cyrus is a DJ, artist, and music enthusiast currently living in Philadelphia, PA. Their monthly radio show Belly Music on Particle.FM explores unconventional connections across sounds pulled from their curious and ever-expanding record collection. Their show regularly features and highlights guests and challenges them to play outside the box of their usual curations. Born and raised in Portland, OR, Cyrus carries with them the organic and hypnotic melancholy that life in the Pacific Northwest fosters. Their expression is informed by spirituality, interactions with the natural world, the vitality of queer community, imagining abolitionist futures, and the conviction that deep listening is the act through which human connection is most readily formed. Belly Music is for the people. When you're here, your family.
