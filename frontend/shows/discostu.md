Originally appearing on 88.1 FM WMUC College Park from 1997-2001, One Nation Under A Groove features all things funky, soulful & groovy. Stu is on a never ending intergalactic voyage to find booty shakin' beats ranging from house/garage/disco to hip-hop/rap/rare groove to footwork/club/drum'n'bass. Can you dig it?
