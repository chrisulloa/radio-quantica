Preaching the holy gospel of jungle, footwork and broken beats from the nations capital.

Amen brother is the latest incarnation in a career of evangelism of the hardcore continuum that has taken this intrepid musical missionary to independent and pirate broadcasts around the world.

Sir, excuse me sir! Do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior, Goldie?

2Thirty8 is a former KSDT and BooshFM host with a new radio residency on Particle FM. Expect everything from Jungle to UK Garage and UK Bass.
