Cashmere is an exploration of sensory sounds from around the world. No genres are off-limits. Xayn is a neurodivergent and incredibly talented multi-media artist based in San Diego. Their work explores the sensory experiences of hearing, smelling, touching. Expect to lose yourself in the sounds of Cashmere.
