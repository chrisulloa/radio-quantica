Moonflower Suite is a radio show that reflects the emotions, reactions and behaviors that arise during the nighttime. Whether the night calls for the club driven pulse of the discoteca or the soothing sonic healing of ambient electronica before drifting off to sleep, this suite will put you in a night mood nevertheless. Tracks interweave between high energy to soft energy echoing the dynamic structures of a symphonic suite. Genres range from electronic, indie, experimental, chamber pop, and beyond.
