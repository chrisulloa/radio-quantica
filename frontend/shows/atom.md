DJ Skawife: spazztic selector, enby legend, Ramona raised and Ramones crazed is your host for the Plum Books radio show. A bi-monthly show exploring specific sounds, scenes, regions, and styles across the wider rocker universe. On any given broadcast you might be exposed to a high voltage selection of huffed up rocker jams or exhume the carcasses of nineties death metal worship, maybe cruise the pit of outsider queer punk. All things DIY with frequent contributions from the suits at Plum Books, a local tape label and press.
